# README

## Directory Structure

- **EX1**: Contains datasets and results for Experiment 1 in the paper, including the assembly code to be verified, the C code generated by Hetrify, and the result files.
- **EX2**: Contains datasets and results for Experiment 2 in the paper.
- **EXAMPLE**: Contains example programs from the paper.
- **Hetrify**: The verification transformation tool designed in this paper.
- **ae**: Auxiliary analysis tool for binary files. Hetrify invokes the `ae` tool during its operation.

## Supported Functions of Hetrify

Hetrify supports the transformation of the following types of code:

- RISC-V assembly programs
- C programs
- C mixed with assembly programs
- RISC-V static library code

## Basic Usage of Hetrify

Assume you want to verify the program `EX1/F/test28-1.s`. You can run Hetrify with the following command:

```sh
./Hetrify ./EX1/ASM/F/test28-1.s
```

This command will generate a C program named `test28-1_gen.c` in the `./EX1/F` directory. You can then use CBMC to verify the correctness of this program.

## Additional Functions of Hetrify

To view the additional functions and usage of Hetrify, use the following command:

```sh
./Hetrify -h
```

## Experiment 1

All files for Experiment 1 are stored in the `EX1` folder, including the assembly code to be verified, the C code generated by Hetrify from the assembly code, and the result files. You can use the `solve.py` script to verify the converted C programs. 

### Example Usage

Assume you want to verify all files in the `C/F` folder with a loop unwind value of 50. You can run the following command:

```sh
cd EX1
python3 solve.py --dir C/F --unwind 50 --output F_50.csv --timeout 600
```

After all programs are verified, a file named `F_50.csv` will be generated, recording the corresponding verification results.
